    <p>UFC 194's main event was nothing short of spectacular. This wasn't because of the way the fight played out, but specifically it's build-up. Fighting is definitely
        one of those things that you can't predict. However, Conor literally did. The two video rendition below summarizes 
        the build-up and fight itself. Enjoy!
